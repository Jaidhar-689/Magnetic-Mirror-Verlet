# Magnetic Mirror Effect using Velocity Verlet Integration

This repository simulates the **magnetic mirror effect** experienced by an electron in Earth's dipole magnetic field. The numerical integration is performed using the **magnetic velocity Verlet method**, which conserves energy well over long trajectories and is a improved verlet method.

## üåç Project Description

An electron with 30 keV energy is launched from the magnetic equatorial plane (at an altitude of 1 Earth radius) in a direction 45¬∞ between north and east. The Earth's magnetic field is modeled using a dipole approximation in spherical coordinates and then converted to Cartesian for simulation. The simulation shows:

- 3D trajectory of the electron
- Magnetic field strength variation
- The classic *magnetic mirror* bounce behavior
- Kinetic energy conservation over time

## üß† Physics & Numerical Method

The magnetic field is given in Polar Cordinates.

**Velocity Verlet integration** is used for updating position and velocity of the particle, ensuring time-symmetric evolution and better energy conservation.
